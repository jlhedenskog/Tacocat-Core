# Tacocat-Core
 
TacoCat is a program that tests whether the word a user enters is a palindrome (a palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backwards and forwards). The program will also print out the reversed word. 

This is a challenge that is usually done in Javascript and while I am using Javascript for user validation, I am using C# for the logic portion.
